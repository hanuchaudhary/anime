                <p class="p">An unnamed male high school student comes across a book in a hospital waiting room. He soon
                    discovers that it is a diary kept by his very popular classmate Sakura Yamauchi, who reveals to him
                    that
                    she is secretly suffering from a fatal illness in her pancreas. Despite this, Sakura intends to
                    maintain
                    a normal school life and thus is drawn to him due to his relatively unfazed reaction to her
                    condition.
                    They begin to spend time together and become friends. <br>
                    During their school break, Sakura invites him on a train trip to Fukuoka where they play
                    truth-or-dare
                    game and eventually share a bed in their hotel room. Afterward, Sakura's friends and classmates grow
                    suspicious and resentful of his newfound closeness to her. The two begin doing activities from
                    Sakura's
                    bucket list together until she is suddenly hospitalized. During her hospitalization, the two sneak
                    out
                    to see fireworks together. <span class="readme"><a

                    Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school student in the rural town of Itomori, Japan. Bored of the town,
                    she
                    wishes to be a Tokyo boy in her next life. Soon, she begins to intermittently switch bodies with
                    Taki
                    Tachibana, a boy from Tokyo. On certain days, Taki and Mitsuha wake up in each other's bodies and
                    must
                    live the entire day as the other, reverting when they go to sleep at night. The two set up ground
                    rules
                    for sharing their bodies, communicating via messages on paper, their phones, and their skin. Mitsuha
                    (in
                    Taki's body) sets Taki up on a date with his coworker, Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body)
                    helps Mitsuha become more popular at school. While in Mitsuha's body, Taki accompanies Mitsuha's
                    grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha to the Shinto shrine on a mountain near Itomori,
                    leaving
                    an offering of kuchikamizake made with Mitsuha's saliva. Hitoha explains that god is the ruler over
                    both
